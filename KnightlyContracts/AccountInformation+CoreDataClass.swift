    /*There are two ways to fix this. The first way is to delete the source code file for each NSManagedObject subclass you manually created. The second way is to turn off the code generation for each of your Core Data entities. For each entity in your data model, open the Data Model Inspector and select Manual/None from the Codegen menu. Go with the first way if you want Xcode to generate the NSManagedObject subclasses for you. Go with the second way if you want to create the NSManagedObject subclasses yourself.*/
